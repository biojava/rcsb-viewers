 * Indicate whether we're in debug state or not.

 * Why is this here?  Ostensibly, it's an app-controller parameter...
 * 
 * The problem is that a commandline app won't instantiate AppBase, nor do we want it brought
 * into the link.  Hence we create it in the model (in util, just to separate it from everything
 * else), so that we can set a debug state, but don't have to bring in an appcontroller to contain
 * it.
 * 
 * Compromises...
